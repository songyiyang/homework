# Interview Homework

This repository contains a bare-bone application including basic authentication.

# To Run the application

Make sure you have Ruby (2.2 or above) and Bundler installed.

To set up the database, run

```console```
bundle install
rake db:reset
```

This will set up the database and it also create 2 users: 'teacher' and 'student'.

To start the web server, run

```console```
bundle exec rails server
```

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000

You can log in as a teacher by using 'teacher' as the username and log in as a student by using 'student' as the username.

Good Luck!
